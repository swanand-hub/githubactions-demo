# Got it — you want a GitHub Actions workflow that can access and print credentials.
# For security reasons, you should never print actual secrets in plain text in logs, because they can be exposed.
# Instead, you can demonstrate how to access them safely, and if you must debug, mask them or print only partial values.
# Here’s a safe sample workflow:
# Yamlname: Print GitHub Credentials (Safe Demo)

on:
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  show-credentials:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Access GitHub Token
        run: |
          echo "GitHub Token (masked): ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}"
          echo "First 4 chars of token: ${GITHUB_TOKEN:0:4}****"
        env:
          GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}

      - name: Example with custom secret
        run: |
          echo "Custom secret (masked): ${{ secrets.SWANAND_DOCKER }}"
          echo "Length of secret: ${#SWANAND_DOCKER}"
        env:
          MY_SECRET: ${{ secrets.SWANAND_DOCKER }}

# How it works:

# secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN is automatically provided by GitHub for authentication in workflows.
# secrets.MY_SECRET is a custom secret you add in Repo Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions.
# The workflow masks secrets in logs automatically, so even if you echo them, they appear as ***.
# For debugging, you can print only partial values or lengths.

# If you want, I can also give you a version that sets up Git credentials so the workflow can push commits to a repo. That would be useful if your goal is automation rather than just printing.
# Do you want me to prepare that version?
